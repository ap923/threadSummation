# threadSummation
Summation using threads in C

Part 1: C program that takes an integer command line argument n, spawns n processes that will
each generate a random numbers between -100 and 100, and then computes and prints out the sum of these
random numbers. Each process needs to print out the random number it generates.
Part 2:  pthread program that takes an integer command line argument n, spawns n threads that will
each generate a random numbers between -100 and 100, and then computes and prints out the sum of these
random numbers. Each thread needs to print out the random number it generates.
